As in title this simulation is about Cops & Robbers. There are three different map sizes with buildings, sidewalks, roads and lawns. Simulation is stilized on old Nintendo games. I made each texture attached to the program myself.

There are two types of Cops:
- infantry, that can walk anywhere except buildings
- police car, that can drive only on road and if it spawns beside road, it can drive only on lawns

There are three types of Robbers:
- small robber,  same as infantry can walk anywhere except buildings
- bike robber, that has 25% chance to escape while being caught
- bank robber, same as police car

Simulation ends when all robbers are caught and then the simulation statistics (e.g duration) are displayed.
